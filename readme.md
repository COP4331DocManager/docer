# Project 6: Document management tool

Develop a web-based document management tool for organizations and teams. The idea is that documents uploaded by different team members will be visible to every team member. The users should be able to upload a scanned version of the document and edit associated metadata such as title, creator, keywords, version number and so on. Users should be able to search for documents based on this metadata. Admins must be able to track and monitor the current workload of the system in terms of the efficiency due to number of people, storage, etc.
